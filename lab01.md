# lab 1

## lab 1.1

* Create a balloon class that encapsulates the states and behaviors of a balloon
** Float (behavior)
** Has a color (state)
** Has position (state)
** Has velocity (state)
** Exist or not (both)

## lab 1.2

* Create 10 balloons and print out their properties (states)

## lab 1.3

* Each balloon now has an private integer id
* Printing the balloon using toString() method will also print out the id
* Come up with a strategy to manage the balloonsâ€™ id:
** Which is strictly monotonic
** Self-managed by the class

**Implies uniqueness of the id field for each balloon**
