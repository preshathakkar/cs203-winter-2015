# lab 5.1: recursion

1. Write a recursive factorial method that computes factorial of n
2. Write a recursive method that simulates the for loop

# lab 5.2 

1. Update the `hasNode(name)` method found in `ListContainer.java` so that it returns a true if a node with `name` exists.

# lab 5.3

1. Design a `Map` container that utilizes everything we've done so far.
   (a) has a add method: `add(key,value)`
   (b) has exist method: `has(key)`
   (c) has a get method: `get(key)`
   (d) has remove method: `remove(key)`
