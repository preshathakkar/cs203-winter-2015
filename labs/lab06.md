# lab 6.1: implement a `set` by hand

(we note that eventhough uuid are more or less unique, we still want to go through the exercise of verifying it's uniqueness)

1. Modify `balloon.java` such each time a balloon is generated it has a unique id.   
2. This id is generated using UUID.
3. We need to make sure that the id is unique before assigning it to the balloon.
