# lab 6.1: implement a `set` by hand

1. Modify `balloon.java` such each time a balloon is generated it has a unique id.   
2. This id is generated using UUID.
3. We need to make sure that the id is unique before assigning it to the balloon.

We note that:

1. Eventhough uuid are more or less unique, we still want to go through the exercise of verifying it's uniqueness.
2. Our approach to maintaining a list of unique uuid's is naive as we shall use an arraylist.

# lab 6.2 time your balloon creation

1. Write the code to get the time of day
2. For every 10,000 balloons being created print the time
3. Plot N versus time
4.
