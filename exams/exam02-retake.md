# Exam 2 retake

## Programming Task

You are given two list of numbers.  The numbers in each list may or may not repeat.  Your task is report all the numbers found in both lists.  For example, given these two arrays:

```java
int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int[] b = {2, 2, 1, 9, 8};
```
Your output would be:

```
common: 1 2
```

Redo the `CircularStringQueue` example provided in [Exam 2](https://github.com/csula/cs203-winter-2015/blob/master/exams/exam02.md) _and_ add one new method `Reverse()`.  This method reverses the queue.

## Theory Task

Please analyze time complexity for programming tasks from above.  Your analysis should be comprehensive and well thoughtout.  In other words, you simply cannot put down "O(n)" or "O(log n)" without explaining why/how.
