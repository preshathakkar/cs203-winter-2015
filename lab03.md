# lab 3.1

Consider slide 45 from chapter 11.  Redo so that it's cleaner and easier to understand.

# lab 3.2

Implement a `Stack` class using `ArrayList` as the internal storage container and use the methods described on slide 47 of chapter 11.  Validate your code with a stack of `Balloon` objects being added in your `main()` method.

# lab 3.3

Let us create an array of `Balloon` called `balloons` of size `N`.  What happens when you try to access `balloons[N]`?  What is the proper way to handle this error?

# lab 3.4

Put together a layout that contains a canvas and three buttons.  On the canvas, draw your balloons.  The buttons are bound to three actions: `start`, `stop`, and `pause` -- for now these buttons don't have to do anything special other than to print out their actions.
