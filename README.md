## Programming with Data Structure Winter 2015

Please refer to the [syllabus](https://github.com/csula/cs203-winter-2015/blob/master/Syllabus.md) for more information about the course.  

## Homework 1

For this homework assignment, we will apply the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming into a simple game.  The game is a shoot the balloons game.  Our game will keep scores of the number of balloons a player successfully shoots down in a fixed time period.  For more information, please refer to [homework01.md](https://github.com/csula/cs203-winter-2015/blob/master/assignments/homework01.md).

## Homework 2

For this homework assignment, we will continue to developing our game.  The game will include features such as recursive programming, complex datastructure (e.g. lists, stacks, queues, sets, and maps).  For more information, please refer to [homework02.md](https://github.com/csula/cs203-winter-2015/blob/master/assignments/homework02.md).

## Homework 3

For this homework assignment, we will implement the sorting and searching algorithms.  We will also take measurements to study their performance.  We compare our measurement against the theoretical performance.

## Homework 4

For this homework assginment, we will implement a simple graph algorithm.  The graph algorithm performs a BFS and DFS search on a given graph.

## Final Project

For the final project, your team will take one of the four homework assignments and build additional features.  These features should demonstrate that you undertand the underlying challenges of computer algorithms and datastructure.
