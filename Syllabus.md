## Course Goals

The Student Learning Outcomes that are addressed by the course are:

- Students will be able to demonstrate fluency in at least one programming language and acquaintance with at least three more.
- Students will have a strong foundation in the design, analysis, and application of many types of algorithms.
- Students will have the training to analyze problems and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to their solutions.
- Students will have the training to design, implement, and evaluate large software systems working both individually and collaboratively.
- Students will be able to communicate effectively orally and in writing.

Other outcomes of instruction: At the end of the course students are able to:

- Use recursion as a tool to solve some specific problems.
- Know the standard Abstract Data Types, and their implementations.
- Study and use different available JAVA Data Structures.
- Know the standard searching and sorting algorithms and their efficiency.
- Understand the complexity analysis for some simple software.
