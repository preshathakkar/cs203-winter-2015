## Grading Allocation

There will be 3 exams that are based on the lectures and programming assignments. The course will also include 4 programming assignments and a final project.

- Homework (4) - 40 points
- Exams (2) - 20 points
- Final Exam  - 20 points
- Project - 20 points

**Final Project** Throughout this quarter we will be building a course project. This project is a cumulation of the homework assignments.  **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**

## Grading Scale

* A: 94 to 100
* A-: 90 to 93
